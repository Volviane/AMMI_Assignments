So if you want to chat about a specific topic, the models cannot produce any relevant information - they say generic utterances or incorrect facts.

This has been investigated in many different ways, but one of the first papers to show this is https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01241. In this work, data is collected by asking one speaker to reference Wikipedia sentences.\n",
